DESCRIPTION

Given the the schema presented below find two actors who cast together the most and list titles of only those movies they were casting together. Order the result set alphabetically by the movie title.

Table film_actor
 Column     | Type                        | Modifiers
------------+-----------------------------+----------
actor_id    | smallint                    | not null
film_id     | smallint                    | not null
...
Table actor
 Column     | Type                        | Modifiers
------------+-----------------------------+----------
actor_id    | integer                     | not null 
first_name  | character varying(45)       | not null
last_name   | character varying(45)       | not null
...
Table film
 Column     | Type                        | Modifiers
------------+-----------------------------+----------
film_id     | integer                     | not null
title       | character varying(255)      | not null
...
The desired output:
first_actor | second_actor | title
------------+--------------+--------------------
John Doe    | Jane Doe     | The Best Movie Ever
...
first_actor - Full name (First name + Last name separated by a space)
second_actor - Full name (First name + Last name separated by a space)
title - Movie title
Note: actor_id of the first_actor should be lower then actor_id of the second_actor


SOLUTION:

-- CTE for pair with most films together
WITH pair_most_films AS

(SELECT first.actor_id, second.actor_id AS other_actor, COUNT(*)
FROM
   (
   SELECT *
   FROM film_actor) first

   INNER JOIN

   (
   SELECT *
   FROM film_actor) second
   ON first.film_id = second.film_id
WHERE first.actor_id < second.actor_id
GROUP BY first.actor_id, second.actor_id
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 1)

-- Get film_id of pair actors + names

SELECT CONCAT(aa.first_name, ' ', aa.last_name) AS first_actor,
CONCAT(aa2.first_name, ' ', aa2.last_name) AS second_actor,
title

FROM

(SELECT pmf.actor_id, other_actor, film_id
FROM pair_most_films AS pmf, film_actor AS fa
WHERE pmf.actor_id = fa.actor_id) test

INNER JOIN

(SELECT pmf.actor_id, other_actor, film_id
FROM pair_most_films AS pmf, film_actor AS fa
WHERE pmf.other_actor = fa.actor_id) test2

ON test.film_id = test2.film_id 

INNER JOIN film

ON test2.film_id = film.film_id

INNER JOIN actor aa

ON test.actor_id = aa.actor_id

INNER JOIN actor aa2

ON test2.other_actor = aa2.actor_id
